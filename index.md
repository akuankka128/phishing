The domain discordc.gift (from URL [http://discordc.gift/FGk24Djqo54s](http://discordc.gift/FGk24Djqo54s)) was taken down by messaging the domain registration provider's abuse report email. The website imitated Discord's login page in hopes of stealing people's logins and passwords.

I was messaged a [link](https://dlscocrd.com/QK8WQq9H67HYfs73) by a compromised Discord account. I promptly took care of it by reporting it to the website's DDoS protection provider, [DDoS-GUARD](https://ddos-guard.net/) via email ([abuse@ddos-guard.net](mailto:abuse@ddos-guard.net)).

History once again repeats itself. A scammer DMs me on a hacked account, I report the website, the website gets taken down. [https://discordhalloween.com/gift/FA2Num8x1ZTc4QkslKNKs9lN](https://discordhalloween.com/gift/FA2Num8x1ZTc4QkslKNKs9lN) taken down by emailing their domain registration provider Namecheap within 2 hours. Gotta give props to those guys for their speed and ease of access!
